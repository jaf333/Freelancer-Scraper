# Freelancer-Scraper
Freelancer Scraper is designed to automate the process of scraping job postings from UpWork.
It utilizes Selenium for web scraping and interacts with the Freelancer website to extract job details, including job titles, descriptions, and proposals. The script then stores the extracted data in a SQLite database for easy access and retrieval.
